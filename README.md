## Routing  (folder based)
We have to create folder inside app. Folder will have the same name as the path. Inside that folder we have to create page.js file. 

## Dynamic Route (for specific id)
For nesting we have use crate a route then inside that route we have to  create a folder with third bracket. For example I have created Products route and inside that route I have created a dynamic route named [id]. 


## Client components
client components are used on different folder. It's used on src folder. We have to use "use client"  on the top of the client component.
