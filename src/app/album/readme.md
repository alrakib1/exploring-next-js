## Image
to use image on nextjs you have to configure the next js config file. you have to add a image object and under this object there should be a domain property. this domain will be an array because you have to use multiple images from different domain.

Also to use image we have to import <Image> from next js. image must contain height, width and alt attribute.

do not use img tag. better use Image tag from next js as next js optimize the image in much better way
