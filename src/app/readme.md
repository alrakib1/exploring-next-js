## Routing  (folder based)
We have to create folder inside app. Folder will have the same name as the path. Inside that folder we have to create page.js file. 

## MetaData
you can use different page title with the help of metadata.

## Link
You can use link to go to different route. But you have to import link from next/link. Link in next js is a little bit different from react. Because in react we use to for direction but in next js we use href for direction just like anchor tag on html.

## Never use "use client" inside the app folder. Those will be server components.
